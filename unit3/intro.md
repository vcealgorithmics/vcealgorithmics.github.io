"An algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks." - wikipedia

Essentially, an algorithm is a set of steps or instructions to do something.

Here are some examples of an algorithm.

Notice that algorithms don't need to be computer code; they can take form in many shapes and sizes. As long as it is some form of list of instructions, it can be considered an algorithm.

A common activity when teaching about algorithmics and software development is to ask yourself to describe a simple task to somebody who has never done it before (they don't have to be real!). This step-by step process forces you to think about each step and action required to create toast, for example. 

This process is so effective, even without talking to another human at deconstructing a process into it's fundamental parts that many development teams use a technique called "rubber duck debugging", by explaining their code line by line to a duck.

The reason we use algorithms is because they are a repeatable list of basic instructions that turn a complex task into it's smaller components. In fact, if we get specific enough, we could create a list of instructions for a computer!
