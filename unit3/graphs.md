Graphs are a blah

give general overview

## Graph properties

Paths : Each edge

Cycles : Paths that loop back (EG. A -B, B-C, C-A)

Connected graph : Any two verticies are connected by some path

Subgraph : A subset of a graph (ie. looking at a subset of nodes and edges in a graph)

Connected component : Maximal connected subgraph (eg, how many disparate, or different non-connected elements inside a signle graph)

Tree : Connected graph without cycles ( A- B, B-C,B-D, but NOT D-A)

Forest : A collection of trees

Distance: The number of "hops" or edges you have to pass through in order to reach a given destination from a given edge ( EG. A-B, B-C, distance from A-C is 2)

Digraphs: Graphs that have edges that contain a direction (eg. A->B but not B -> A)(eg. A one way road)

Degree : The number of edges connected to a node (EG. A-B, A-C, A-D, A has a degree of 3)

Out Degree : The degree of edges going out from an node in a digraph

In Degree : The degree of edges going in from an node in a digraph

Width : The maximum number of edges between any two nodes
