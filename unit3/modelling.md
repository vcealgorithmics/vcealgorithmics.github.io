By using graphs, we can model a huge number of systems in real life.

Take the brain, for example; each neuron as a node, and each connection between neurons as edges. Or perhaps a railway network, or a set of highways, each destination a node, and each path an edge. It's easy to see how a graph is useful and related to these systems, although graphs also can be applied to systems that might not quite be so obvious.

A common way of visualising a graph is to use circles as nodes, and the lines drawn between them as edges.

The reason we use graphs is because they are able to simplify many systems into two simple lists. A list of nodes (for example, ...), and a list of pairs or edges (known as an adjacency list) (for example...)
