Recursion occurs when something is self refferential; that is, it calls itself.


## Examples of recursion

### Maths

If you've studied sequences and series (VCE Specialist Mathematics)...

A particularly famous recurrance relation is the fibbonaci sequence, which follows the simple form of 

> Start at 1

> take the last two numbers and add them to get the next number
> do the next step in the fibbonachi sequence

### Geometry

A particularly interesting form of recursion exists in fractals, geometric shapes that repeat over and over again.

If you've ever pointed two mirrors at each other, and seen the mirror reflecting itself infinitely, you've seen this form of recursion at play.
