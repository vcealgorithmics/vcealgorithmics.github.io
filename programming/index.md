There are three languages VCAA have approved for [2017](http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Pages/vce/studies/algorithmics/algorithmics-approved-lists.aspx). These are :

 - Edgy, a block based programming language

 - Python, a text-based programming language (with NetworkX and matplotlib for graph functionality)

 - Wolfram Mathematica, a scientific computing language 


Edgy is the best language for students new to programming, as it's block-based nature allows for quick and intuitive programming, however experienced programmers may wish to use python, as it has a far larger feature-set, is used extensively in industry and some prefer it's text-based interface.

Wolfram Mathematica is used fairly often in scientific and Engineering fields, and students who have experience may wish to have a look at it, however it will not be supported by any tutorials on this site.
