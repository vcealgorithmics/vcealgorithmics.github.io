[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a beginner friendly text-based programming language. In order to use Python in Algorithmics, students will have to use [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/), a python library for manipulating graphs, as well as [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) or some other NetworkX compatible rendering library.


An installation guide to networkX can be found in it's doccumentation [here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/development/install.html). The reccomended installation method is via pip.


Students who are familiar with text-based languages may wish to check out [Edgy](/programming/edgy), a text-based language that is also VCAA approved.

This is one of the three languages allowed for [2017](http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Pages/vce/studies/algorithmics/algorithmics-approved-lists.aspx)
