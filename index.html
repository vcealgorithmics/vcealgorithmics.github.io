<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>This site is an attempt to provide an additional resource primarily for students studying VCE Algorithmics, however may also serve as a resource for students studying algorithms in general, specifically graph theory. Much of the site is still under construction.</p>

<p> This site will assume that you are familiar with programming (variables, iteration/loops, functions, if/else statements). In the future, it may post tutorial content.
