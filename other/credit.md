Both Monash University and [Melbourne University] have structured credit policies for VCE Algorithmics.

Monash University :

>  At Monash University Students who have successfully completed VCE Algorithmics will receive credit for 2 first year units when they enrol with the Faculty of Information Technology:
        Credit for FIT1045 Introduction to Algorithms and Programming
        Credit for one Information Technology 1st year Elective
    This credit effectively amounts to 50% of one semester load. With overloading students may be able to accelerate their degree by 1/2 year (1 unit overload for 2 semesters).
    On the basis of this credit students can enter straight into some Level 2 units.
    From 2016 the Faculty of IT will additional consider giving ATAR increments for successful completion of VCE Algorithmics.\

[Melbourne Unversity :](http://www.cis.unimelb.edu.au/study/undergraduate/)

> Students who satisfactorily complete VCE Algorithmics are offered 25 points of first year credit towards the Bachelor of Science and the Bachelor of Biomedicine, and pre-requisite waivers to permit enrolment in the following subjects during their first year, with concurrent enrolment in 25 points of first year mathematics.

Semester 1: One of the following:

    COMP20007 Design of Algorithms; students must pass a C programming proficiency test at the start of semester (and optionally attend a 1-2 week intensive C programming course immediately before semester begins)

    COMP20005 Engineering Computation; this subject covers C programming and does not presume prior knowledge of C

Semester 2: One of the following:

    COMP20003 Algorithms and Data Structures; not permitted following COMP20007

    SWEN20003 Object Oriented Software Development

    INFO20002 Foundations of Informatics

    INFO20003 Database Systems

**Author's Note : ** Unfortunately many of the links to university information about algorithmics are dead. For example, boh [Melbourne University](http://www.cis.unimelb.edu.au/schools/algorithmics.html) and [Monash University's](https://it.monash.edu/algorithmics) official pages either 404 or redirect. Instead, the above information has been quoted from an [atarnotes post](http://atarnotes.com/forum/index.php?topic=165319.0), but roughly lines up with what I remember on those sites, as well as the information provided by schools.
